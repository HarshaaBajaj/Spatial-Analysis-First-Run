# Spatial-Analysis-First-Run

Initial spatial analysis of Boston businesses 


#### Given 
Data set with business names and their point location (latitude,longitude) coordinates


#### Objective 

Answer the following questions,
1. Are the points randomly distributed or is there a pattern?  
2. If they're not random, identify clusters of points.

### 1. Are the points randomly distributed or is there a pattern?

#### Hypothesis 
The exploratory data analysis helped in making a hypothesis that **there is a pattern**

#### Testing

Different types Quadrat tests and Ripleyâ€™s K test prove the hypothesis to be correct, and the data seems to be clustered over certain locations

### 2. If they're not random, identify clusters of points.   

The following techniques are then tested to identify the cluster points

* **Stienen approach**
* **Nearest Neighbour**
* **Density-Based Spatial Clustering**
